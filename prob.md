## Multi Linear Regression

- What does statistical significance stand for in multi linear regression?
    - Keep other variables fixed.
- Is it possible, for variable A, the coefficient is positive in simple linear
regression, but negative when adding other variables?
    - Possible, compounding...

## Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 

- What is one-way ANOVA?
    - Two-levels of treatments -> t-test.
    - difference between linear regression when considering
      significance.
- What is multi-way ANOVA?
    - Randomized block design.
        - When there are exact two levels of treatmemts in each block,
        it is equal to paired t-test.
    - What if considering the interaction between groups?
        - Df of groups and interactions.
- Type of sum of squares?
    - type I, type III.
    - Why the order of ANOVA matters when data are unbalanced?
- Why df > 10 is required?
    - Think about t-student distribution, small df means it requires larger
    bias for statistical significance.
    - And usually (not precisely true), smaller data indicates higher variety.
    So it requires more variety presented to convince the null hypothesis is false.
