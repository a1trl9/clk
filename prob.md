## Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 

- What is one-way ANOVA?
    - Two-levels of treatments -> t-test.
    - difference between linear regression when considering
      significance.
- What is multi-way ANOVA?
    - Randomized block design.
        - When there are exact two levels of treatmemts in each block,
        it is equal to paired t-test.
    - What if considering the interaction between groups?
        - Df of groups and interactions.
- Type of sum of squares?
    - type I, type III.
    - Why the order of ANOVA matters when data are unbalanced?
