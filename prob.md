# Probability and Mathematical Analysis

## Simple Linear Regression
- What are definitions of error and residual? What is the difference.
    - Observed value with true value / estimated value.

## Multi Linear Regression

- What does statistical significance stand for in multi linear regression?
    - Keep other variables fixed.
- Is it possible, for variable A, the coefficient is positive in simple linear
regression, but negative when adding other variables in multi one?
    - Possible, compounding...
- What is the matrix formulation of OLR?

## Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 

- What is one-way ANOVA?
    - Two-levels of treatments -> t-test.
    - Difference between linear regression when considering
      significance.
- What is multi-way ANOVA?
    - Randomized block design.
        - When there are exact two levels of treatmemts in each block,
        it is equal to paired t-test.
    - What if considering the interaction between groups?
        - Df of groups and interactions.
- Type of sum of squares?
    - Type I, type III.
    - Why the order of ANOVA matters when data are unbalanced?
- Why df > 10 is required?
    - Think about t-student distribution, small df means it requires larger
    bias for statistical significance.
    - And usually (not precisely true), smaller data indicates higher variety.
    So it requires more variety presented to convince the null hypothesis is false.

## Extension

- What is measure?
    - A function.
    - Countable additivity.
    - Non-negativity.
    - Null empty set.
- What is sigma-algebra?
    - Closed under complementation.
    - Closed under countable unions.
- What are measure space and measurable space, what is the difference?
- What are probability measure and probability space?
- What is random variable?
    - A function from outcome (sample space) to a measurable space (usually real-valued).
