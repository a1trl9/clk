# Machine Learning
This is a collection of any math questions met during learning ML.
Therefore, the contents might not be structured well..
ALl of these will finally be archived to other two (or three) files.

## Calculus


### Derivative

#### Continuity

- What are boundedness theorem and extreme value theorem?

### Integral

#### Limit
- Comparison test...
- **Skill**, Sometimes.. divide the integral to two parts...

#### Integral with a parameter
- uniform convergence
    - The order of integral / derivative / limit... (proper / improper)
    - paramter in bounds...

#### Iterated integral
- **important**: the relationship between multiple integral and iterated integral,
in which cases, they can be transformed with each other...
- How to use polar coordinate system for simplification?
- When could we transform the product of two integrals to an iterated integral?

#### Line integral

- Green's theorem (to multiple integral)

#### Multiple integral

- Mapping from U to V, how to calculate the integral?
    - First order derivative: continuous...
    - Jacobian matrix -- determinant is not equal to zero....
    - Using polar coordinate system to simplifty the calculation.

## Algebra
- positive matrix --> eigenvalue all positive...
- Distance in SVM --> why coefficient vector is perpendicular to the line...


## Probability
- when mapping variables from x to y, what is the pdf?
    - how about for multivariate function?
        - jacobian... (multiple integral) 
    - Think about when function is invertible...
- Maximum Likelihood -> bias of variance (why)
- Multivariate normal distribution...
