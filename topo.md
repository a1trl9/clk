# Topology

## Set

- Why we use axiom of separation?
    - Russell's paradox.
    - ZFC
- What is power set?
- What is equinumerous?
- What is countable set?
    - countably infinite (surjective)
- How to prove Q is countable while R is not?
- Why if X is countable, then X x X is also countable?
    - Starting from N x N.
- How to prove R and P(N) are equinumerous?
- P(Q) and P(Z) --> equinumerous
- How to prove for any X, X and P(X) are not equinumerous?

## Topological space
### In R

- What is open set, what is closed set?
    - How about the union / intersection of open / closed sets...
- If given any sequence S in F, s is convergent to x, and x is belong to F,
then f is a closed set, why?
- Heine-Borel
