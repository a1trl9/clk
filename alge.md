# Linear Algebra
## Linear Space & Linear Map

- What is linear (vector) space?
- What is the basis of linear space?
    - Dimension and basis.
- What is the dimension of a linear (vector) space?
    - When the dimension of space is n, given n vectors which could present all vectors in the space,
    these vectors construct a basis.
- What is a change of a basis?
- What is the definition of linear subspace?
    - closed under addition and scalar multiplication.
    - zero vector?
- Trivial Subspace?
- Sum & intersection of two subspaces (what is the difference?).
- Is the sum / interaction of subspaces still a subspace? Why?
- Dimension of the sum of two subspaces.
- What is direct sum of two subspaces (Prove by round)?
    - zero vector?
    - dimension of direct sum?
    - intersection of two subspaces?
- How about for n number of subspaces?
- Try to prove, why for a subspace M of space V, there must be a complementary subspace.
